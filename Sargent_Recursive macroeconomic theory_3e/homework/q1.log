! Infinite glue shrinkage found in a paragraph.
l.31 
     
The paragraph just ended includes some glue that has
infinite shrinkability, e.g., `\hskip 0pt minus 1fil'.
Such glue doesn't belong there---it allows a paragraph
of any length to fit on one line. But it's safe to proceed,
since the offensive shrinkability has been made finite.

of any length to fit on one line. But it's safe to proceed,

! Undefined control sequence.
l.76 \grafone
             {pic1.ps,height=2.1in}{}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

Runaway argument?
! Paragraph ended before \end was complete.
<to be read again> 
                   \par 
l.83 
     
I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
