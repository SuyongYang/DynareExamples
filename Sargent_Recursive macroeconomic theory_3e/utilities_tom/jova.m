%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  
%  a revised version of jovanovic's model 
%  Given current human capital level, the worker decides how to devide time
%  between investment in human capital and search for other jobs. The 
%  probabilty of getting another offer depends on search effort. The worker
%  can always stay in his current job if he wants to. The distribution of new 
%  job offers is uniform in the program.
